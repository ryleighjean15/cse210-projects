Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can see the history of changes and collaborate on projects as a team.

One of the benefits of version control is the collaboration. Multiple developers can work on different parts of a project simultaneously without overwriting each other's work. Changes from different team members can be merged together, and conflicts can be identified and resolved systematically.

Consider a team of developers working on a new software application. Each developer works on a different feature branch. Version control allows them to commit their changes independently and later merge them into a main branch. This approach ensures that the main branch always contains a stable version of the project while enabling developers to work on new features or bug fixes without ruining each other’s work.

One commonly used Git command is git commit. This command saves the changes made to the local repository. Here’s an example:
git commit -m "Add new feature for user authentication"
This command records the changes made to the files in the staging area with a message describing the changes ("Add new feature for user authentication"). By using git commit, developers can keep a detailed history of what was changed and why, which is helpful for debugging and understanding the evolution of the codebase.
